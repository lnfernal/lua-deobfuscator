# REMOVED FILES
devirtualizer_main.cpp (thread safety not complete)

main.cpp (literally useless only skids)

# TODO (not complete because DEVLEOPER cyclothymic is LAZY)
z3 for storage, sat stuff (deserializer etc)

make thread safe some funcs

fix some shitty cfg passes

put new superop handler (im lazy cus im afraid of skids)

finish rewrite opcode handler (crigge old ew i put old ophandler atm)

use new bc i/O stream O(1) impelemetntyion for deserializer helper OK?

make vm handler priority (which vm identifier to attempt verify first, and so on) ye cus i used a shitty dp called chain-of-responsibility

# SUPPORT (omg cyclothymic blocks me on Discord im a poor skid)
